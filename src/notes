Angular Notes:

1) Runtime.js => This is foe webpack runtime.
2) Polyfill.js => Helps to run new ES version JavaScript on old browsers.
3) Vendor.js => Actual project code which I coded (Component, Modules, Model)
4) Main.js => Points to the first module of the project
5) Styles.js => All CSS code goes here.

IF you want to run:
Type: ng serve => [This is from the hard disk of the computer that you are working on.]
Type: localhost:4200

If you want the application to be loaded from the dist folder:
Type: localhost:4200/dist/CustomerApplication/ => [This is from in-memory]


ng serve => build in-memory
ng build => creates a physical build


In ngModel directive:
(ngModel) = "CustomerModel.CustomerCode" => Sends data from UI to the object
[ngModel] = "CustomerModel.CustomerCode" => receives data from UI to object
[(ngModel)] = "CustomerModel.CustomerCode" => Two-way binding

Find and kill PORT 4200:
sudo lsof -t -i tcp:4200 | xargs kill -9

npm view jquery versions => Will display all jquery versions.

"jquery" : "^2.1.4" => Will install Latest Minor and Revision
"jquery" : "~2.1.4" => Will install only same version
